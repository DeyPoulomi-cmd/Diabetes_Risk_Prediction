# Diabetes Risk Prediction


## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of diabetes using machine learning techniques. By analyzing key predictors such as glucose levels, BMI, and age, the model aims to identify high-risk individuals and support early intervention strategies. The dataset used for this project is provided by the "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases."

## Objectives
- Develop a classification model to predict diabetes risk.
- Identify key predictors influencing the risk of diabetes.
- Provide actionable insights to aid in proactive healthcare interventions.
## Dataset Details
- **Source:** National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
- **Features:**
  - **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL).
  - **BMI:** Body Mass Index.
  - **Age:** Patient's age in years.
  - Additional features are included for comprehensive analysis.
## Key Highlights
- **Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Algorithms Used:** Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
- **Performance Metrics:** Achieved accuracy of XX% and F1-score of XX%.
## Business Insights
 High glucose levels, BMI, and age are significant predictors of diabetes.
- Middle-aged to older individuals are at higher risk.
- Overweight individuals should focus on maintaining healthy glucose levels and regular exercise.

## Installation
